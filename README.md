# StudentsApp

Simple student calendar built with [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/).

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser to view the calendar.
You can switch between month, week, and day views. Use the modal dialog to create,
edit, or delete events. Each event supports a description and color selection and
is stored in `localStorage`.

## Development
Install dependencies and start a dev server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The provided VS Code configuration (`.vscode/`) lets you launch a Chrome session
with debugging enabled. Use the **Launch Chrome against localhost** configuration
from the Run and Debug panel.
